How the App Got Off Base: Mixing Client and Server
The core problem was a case of mixing presentation (client) logic with core service (server) logic within the same directory.

1. The Architectural Ambiguity
The folder Desktop_app/ was initially designed to house the files for a client-side application (the "Desktop GUI"). However, two fundamentally different components ended up inside it:

The FastAPI Server (main.py): This is the backend service. Its job is to run 24/7, handle HTTP requests, perform ML predictions, and manage the database. It belongs at a high level in the architecture.

The TUI Client (review_tui.py): This is the presentation layer. Its job is to run only when the user opens it, display information, and send requests to the server.

By placing the Server (main.py) inside the folder meant for the Client (Desktop_app), you created friction.

2. The Resulting Structural Friction
This mixing caused problems in two main areas:

A. Import Path Confusion
When main.py was inside Desktop_app/, it had to access critical resources like the ML model located in AI_project_root/models/. Python then had a hard time resolving these relative paths because the server was nested too deeply in an unexpected location. We often saw ModuleNotFoundError errors because of this.

B. Difficult Execution
You couldn't run the server and the client from the same directory easily without complex Python package structure hacks (like adding __init__.py files or manipulating sys.path). This made the simple act of launching the app difficult to explain and reproduce reliably.

The Fix: Separation of Concerns
The recent overhaul solved this by enforcing a clean separation of concerns:

Server is Core: Moving main.py to the Project Root tells Python and the developer, "This is the main, high-level service for the entire project."

Client is Isolated: Renaming Desktop_app to tui_client and deleting the old GUI files clearly defines it as the single, active client application.

By separating the server and the client into distinct areas, you've created a structure that is now logical, easy to run, and much more scalable. The server can run independently, and the client knows exactly where to find it via the defined API_BASE_URL.

1. Structural Fix: Enforcing Separation
The first section of the checklist fixes the core confusion by establishing clear boundaries:

Move main.py to Project Root: This elevates the FastAPI Server to its proper place as the project's central service. This immediately cleans up pathing issues for crucial dependencies like the ML model.

Rename and Purge: Renaming Desktop_app/ to tui_client/ and deleting the old GUI files explicitly signals that the TUI is the only presentation layer, eliminating ambiguity and removing dead code.

This structural separation is the foundation of a clean, runnable application.

2. Functional Fix: TUI-Server Handshake
The second and third sections of the checklist ensure the two newly separated parts can communicate properly:

Adding GET /get_products_for_review: This is the most crucial new code. The TUI needs data for review (P-6), and the server was not exposing a dedicated endpoint for this. This step ensures the server can efficiently send the TUI exactly the data it needs to work.

Rewriting tui_client/review_tui.py with requests: By relying solely on requests and network calls, the TUI is now a true client. It doesn't need to know anything about database credentials or model file paths; it just needs the server's URL. This finalizes the architecture by ensuring the TUI is completely dependent on the server API, as intended.

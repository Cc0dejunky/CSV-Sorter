P1	---[   ]	PHASE 1: Preparation	Input Widget: User provides the local path to the raw CSV file.		Config.py  (Checks file path validity).	File path is validated, and a temporary staging file is created.																				
P2	---[   ]	Normalization	Progress Bar & Spinner: Displays "Normalizing Data... [XX%]" with a scrolling status log.		CSV_Processor.py , Data_generator.py.	Raw text is cleaned, normalized against the standard vocabulary, and attributes are generated.																				
P3	---[   ]	Embedding	Progress Bar & Spinner: Displays "Generating Embeddings... [XX%]" (after normalization is complete).		Generate_embeddings.py (or Enbedding_generator.py ).	Numerical vector embeddings are created for the normalized product text.
